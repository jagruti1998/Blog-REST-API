# Blog-REST-API
Creating REST API Spring Boot Project for Blog Application

A blogging Application is a web-based application that allows users to create and publish blog posts, read and comment on other users' posts, and categorize posts by topics.
The application has a user authentication system that allows users to create accounts, login, logout securely, resetting passwords, and updating account information.
It uses a RESTful API to handle requests and responses between the frontend and backend of the application.
The API allows for CRUD operations on blog posts, comments, categories, and user accounts.
